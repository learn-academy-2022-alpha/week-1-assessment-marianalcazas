# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

 What is a conditional statement?

  Your answer: A conditional statement is a structure that adds value to the code. It is knowing as "if" and "else" and when used in programing create logic for a more complex code. 

  Researched answer: Conditional statement is also know as decision trees and it gives a foundation to computer programming. It gives back a particular result depending on the value logged in. 



1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer: Git is a software that is located on your personal computers. It is local, so it stays in your machine. In general it is not wise to use it only on your computer, since if something happens with the computer everything inside of it would be gone. This is where Github comes into play. Github is a remote platform that people can access from anywhere and from any computer. It receives the information from git that is local and keeps it  online in the cloud. 
 
  Researched answer: 
 Git is a free system that is used for people who work with programming. It is widely used for sharing and working on code. Git guides and keeps track of source code history. Github is a cloud support service that allows people to navigate into git repositories. 


2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer: The Javascript operator that will return a boolean value is "OR" || logical operator when it returns true or false. The value cannot be different, as it needs to be exactly the same to be considered a boolean value.

  Researched answer: In my search regarding boolean values, I found on the Mozilla website that "The logical OR ( || ) operator (logical disjunction) for a set of operands is true if and only if one or more of its operands is true. It is typically used with boolean (logical) values. When it is, it returns a Boolean value." Meaning that the value can not be different to be considered a boolean.



3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: An index is used in array to give back a value and it starts to count the elements with the number zero. The first element in an array has an index zero. The difference between an index and a value is that the value has a specific index so we can retrieve a specific value.


  Researched answer: Looking at my class syllabus, I found that index is located in an array. Indexes are numbers that can be compared to an address for each element found in the array. The elements are numbered starting with 0 and increasing one number a time. The difference between index and value is the content. Each element in an array is called the value and we can retrieve specific value by calling on its index. 



4. What is iteration?

  Your answer: Iteration is a control instruction also known as loop. It allows the programmer to generate repetitive tasks that will have to performed over and over again until achieving a result. 

  Researched answer: Iteration is the action of doing a singular operation a particular number of times or until a condition is found. A commom form of iteration is known as "for loop". A "for loop" characterizes a variable and increment or decrement the variable on each iteration. 



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: When programming it is important to have two people working together; one as the driver and the other as the navigator. The driver will have their hands on the computer, typing and writing the code, while the navigator will observe to see if there is typing errors or to ensure the line of the code is right. It is important to take turns and switch parts recurrently. 

  Researched answer: Pair programming is a crucial procedure for promoting the best quality code. It reduces the risk of mistakes, while bringing awareness for a more organized code. While pair programming, two developers work together in a rhythm where one is going to be the driver writing the code while the other is going to be the navigator reviewing the lines of code as it is typed. 



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: A function which takes another function as an argument or returns a function from it is knowing as a higher order function. 

2. Jest: is one of the most popular test runner currently. As said before it is a Javascript test runner, that offers a library for creating, running and give structuring tests. 

3. Objects: Objects are variables that can contain many values. In Javascript you create a object with an object literal. 

4. Method:  Are the action that can be done on objects. It is a property that have a function definition. 

5. Classes: Also known as ES6. It is not an object it is a template for javascript objects.
